In this view, we instruct Turbo to do two things:
The first line tells Turbo to prepend to the Turbo Frame with id quotes the app/views/quotes/_quote.html.erb partial. As we can see, it's straightforward to pass a partial and locals to the turbo_stream helper.
The second line tells Turbo to update the Turbo Frame with id new_quote with empty content.
